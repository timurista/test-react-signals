    "abstract": "The orphan nuclear receptor SXR coordinately regulates drug clearance in response to a wide variety ofxenobiotic compounds. The disclosure demonstrates that an HIV protease inhibitor binds SXR and activates its target genes. SXR ligands activate expression of MRP2, a critical regulator of bile flow and biliary drug excretion. Therefore, SXR binding compounds can be used for regulating drug clearance and treatment of hepatic disorders associated with impaired bile flow. The present invention relates to new methods of modifying drug clearance and avoiding multi-drug resistance by modifying SXR activity. SXR is a transcriptional activator of MDR1, cytochrome P40-3A4 and cytochrome P40 2C8. SXR activation can significantly increase the metabolic inactivation and efflux of a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents, for example taxanes. Reducing and/or preventing SXR activation therefore diminishes drug resistance and drug clearance and forms the basis of important therapeutic methods which increase the performance of drugs, such as taxanes. Screening and drug identification methods are described which can identify drugs which are not susceptible to SXR related inactivation and increased efflux. In addition, drugs which can reduce these effects for other agents are provided.",

The antigen thus obtained is conjugated to a spacer molecule, and the free end of the latter is then conjugated to a chromatographic affinity column. The column is then utilized to purify raw antibodies to S. pneumoniae bacteria, thereby producing antigen-specific antibodies. A portion of such antibodies is conjugated to a labeling agent which displays a visible color change upon reaction of the antibodies with their antigenic binding partner and embedded in a first zone of an immunochromatographic assay device. Another portion of such antibodies is bound to the reaction zone of the device which has a view window. When a liquid sample, such as patient urine, cerebrospinal fluid or blood is applied to the first zone, the conjugate of antibodies and labeling agent and the sample move along a flow strip of bibulous material to the reaction zone wherein, if the sample contains S. pneumoniae or its cell wall antigen, a sandwich is formed among the labeled conjugate, the antigen and the bound antibodies and a color change is observed. The immunochromatographic assay thus performed is completed within about 15 minutes. This assay affords a basis for rapid and reliable diagnosis of various pathogenic states caused by S. pneumoniae including pneumonia, bronchitis, otitis media, sinusitis, meningitis, and secondary disease states that commonly occur when primary pneumonic infection caused by this bacterium persists undiminished over a time period of 3-5 days.",

The data are duplicated inside the network towards a plurality of processing machines (14a, 14b), which receive each the received data. In each processing machine the correspondence between the received data and the transmitted data is ascertained. Each processing machine processes the data to reconstruct a fraction of the three-dimensional image of the volume to be imaged. At the end of the acquisition, and hence of the inline real-time reconstruction, a dedicated machine collects the set of fraction of images to reconstitute the three-dimensional image. The resulting improved systolic processing compared to the known multicast MPI (message passing interface) enables the speed, reliability and flexibility of the real-time tomographic restitution of moving small laboratory animals to be increased at a lower cost.",

Year 2012 was imported to the country to 12,000 ten thousand tons oeha 170 million dollars was paid.  Korea boasts the world&#39;s highest level of thermal power plants and have (responsible for 50% of power) management system itself is free, and world-class ratio itself as a world-class sub, but the background is cheongil cliff.  There is no himang our country there is two one ton coal production.  Imported coal is there is to meet the testing standards ASTM 10 different items, that is the first to arrive 28 minutes   Hopefully Bo-bonus pay much more than the fine stands at the crossroads of heotjangsa.  This is a country, which first checks whether the mine gateway for coal supply for power generation arrives water. (As Received Base Total Moisture) Moisture arrival is the determining factor in the cost of the business sector.  Who holds win the decisive factor in the cost of the business sector of the invention relates to a new crusher for coal development.    2) to solve problems    Business to deliver the coal to the power plant belongs to the great work.  And the economy - the hardware resources can be seen (cleaning) industry as the core of its inde The six arranged mineral project and is the largest coking coal project in that.  Of course there are two sheets Immobilizer groups.  The core of coking coal business (industry) will win the war on the water.  Where to get the conclusion of the fight ASTM standards are 10 items of the first item gets moisture.  The answer is supply of all items are already known.  Getting water only is not known.  Since there are many variables during no choice but to wait for the decision of the water war.    3) The solving means of the problem    The challenges to solve in the coal supply business there is to be passed to ASTM ten kinds of test items have to know everything in advance, but the first nine harbor was not a topic that can be seen during the advance, there is a variable.  The core of the coal delivery business that was to win the war against the water.  Previously there was no absolute armory (weapons) to win.  The weapons that can not be won by all means in the battle against the water soon, a standard for new coal grinder patent development.  Major surface of the impact mill to replace the principle of seontanjang (line square) in the existing coal pulverizer to a size for the present invention is the development of Patent Pil In war with water.  Easy to be liberated from the hard difficulty knowing everything is difficult if you do not know.    4) effects.    Companies that produce and supply the coal for power generation is a very large single-item production company into the largest company group.  There should be focused just used the machine, and the machine will be the patented invention.  A machine that can be treated, made the deal for the formality, the deal will be made subject to the Plant into the machine.

This uniformity results in improved bioavailability of incorporated compounds (i.e., pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals) as reflected in various pharmacokinetic parameters including, but not limited to, decreased Tmax, increased Cmax, and increased AUC. The improved method of making these uniform nanoemulsions utilizes microfluidization which differs in both process and mechanics when compared to conventional milling and grinding techniques used to generate nanoparticulate compositions. Further, the improvement results, in part, from a novel step of mixing a substantially soluble compound into a heated dispersion medium. This is unlike current nanoparticulate composition methods that mix an insoluble compound with an unheated dispersion medium. Further, these nanoemulsions are observed to be bacterial-resistant and stable to extremes in both temperature and pH changes. Consequently, these nanoemulsions are expected to have a significantly prolonged shelf-life than currently available nanoemulsions.",

Sludge containing high levels of recycling bacteria are selectively collected and separated from the remaining sludge, uncoupling the solids retention time (SRT) of the recycling bacteria from the wasting bacteria. Elevated recycling bacteria SRTs increase concentrations of nitrifying bacteria in the aeration basin and Anammox bacteria in the anoxic basin, improving nitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation.

The system and method uses a sequence of detectors of increasing complexity and face/non-face discriminating thresholds to quickly discard non-faces at the earliest stage possible, thus saving much computation compared to prior art systems. The detector-pyramid architecture for multi-view face detection uses a coarse-to-fine and simple-to-complex scheme. This architecture solves the problem of lengthy processing that precludes real-time face detection effectively and efficiently by discarding most of non-face sub-windows using the simplest possible features at the earliest possible stage. This leads to the first real-time multi-view face detection system which has the accuracy almost as good as the state-of-the-art system yet 270 times faster, allowing real-time performance.",

    "abstract": "The production of polysubstituted cyclobutanes and polysubstituted cyclobutenes according to the prior art necessitated special substrates and reaction conditions, thus being poor in generality. Further, the industrial production of polysubstituted cyclobutanes was problematic in the kind or amount of the catalyst or solvent to be used. The invention provides a process for the production of polysubstituted cyclobutanes with high stereoselectivity which is applicable to industrial practice from the standpoints of operation, substrate generality, catalyst, solvent, and efficiency and is ecologically advantageous by virtue of its low environmental load. Namely, polysubstituted, cyclobutane, cyclobutene, or bicyclo[4.2.0]octane compounds can be produced efficiently, stereoselectively and ecologically advantageously by making a Brønsted acid act on a mixture of an enol ether or a 2-siloxydiene compound with an alkene or alkyne compound substituted with carbonyl at the 1-position either without a solvent or in a nonaqueous solvent.",

According to the inventive method, the rate of consumption of CO2, which is affected by permanently variable environmental conditions, is determined by means of a device measuring gas exchange, the analysed air has a constant CO2 content, the initial parameters such as volumetric flow rate and physiological variables such as stomatic resistance are measured, and net photosynthesis is calculated from both CO2 consumption and the relevant initial parameters. The method is characterized by subsequent correlation of the CO2 consumption rate and net photosynthesis, thus making it is possible to neutralize the permanently variable environmental conditions affecting the result by virtue of the fact that regression analysis occurs between CO2 consumption and net photosynthesis and by proceeding to re-calculate CO2 consumption and net photosynthesis on this basis if required.",

The primary action of a drug usually involves binding to a protein; secondary actions may express themselves in the form of side effects and in some cases may be due to binding to other proteins. Consequently, it is useful to identify all physiologically relevant sites of action of a drug or toxin. A simple method for obtaining a list of the potential targets of a drug, toxin or other biologically active substance (referred to collectively as ligands) involves a multistep process. The first step is screeening a protein or peptide library to identify library members that exhibit high affinity for a particular ligand. The second step involves searching of sequence data bases for proteins that contain the sequences of the library members shown to have high affinity for the ligand. The proteins thus identified constitute a list of potential targets for the ligand. If random peptide libraries have been used, the position of identified consensus sequences within the identified protein constitutes an identification of the potential ligand binding site on the target.",

In the case of at least some of the quadratures, some the basis functions include integrable singularities. The solver divides the problem boundary into a plurality of problem intervals, to which it maps the canonical interval. To integrate a problem interval for a target point, the solver employs a precomputed quadrature that is associated with the target point&#39;s relative position and that was generated by using a basis in which a singularity occurs at each canonical-\u00adinterval location that was mapped to a geometrical singularity on the problem interval. The quadrature results in high-\u00adorder accuracy even if no individual basis function includes a singularity whose shape is the same as one induced by the geometric singularity. These quadratures can be coupled with a Fast Multipole Method (&#39;FMM&#39;) to evaluate layer potentials rapidly and with high accuracy.",

One method includes analyzing the acceleration of light positive ions, for example protons, through interaction of a high-power laser pulse with a double-layer target using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and a one-dimensional analytical model. The maximum energy acquired by the accelerated light positive ions, e.g., protons, in this model depends on the physical characteristics of the heavy-ion layer-the electron-ion mass ratio and effective charge state of the ions. The hydrodynamic equations for both electron and heavy ion species solved and the test-particle approximation for the protons is applied.

The inventive method consists in burdening a tested material with Na or K chloride, carrying out the assay melting thereof in a mixture with litharge, dissolving the thus obtained metal bead in nitrohydrochloric acid and in analysing the diluted solution by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption or atomic emission methods. Said method makes it possible to maximally preserve the analysed components. The traditional sample preparation methods cause the loss of the main portion of the analysed Au, Pt and Pd which are present in the form of organic compounds.",

Given functional imaging data acquired while a subject reads a text passage, a reconstruction of the text passage is produced. Linguistic semantic vector representations are assigned (1301) to words, phrases or sentences to be used as training stimuli. Basis learning is performed (1305), using brain imaging data acquired (1303) when a subject is exposed to the training stimuli and the corresponding semantic vectors for training stimuli, to learn an image basis directly. Semantic vector decoding (1309) is performed with functional brain imaging data for test stimuli and using the image basis to generate a semantic vector representing the test imaging stimuli. Text generation (1311) is then performed using the decoded semantic vector representing the test imaging stimuli.",
